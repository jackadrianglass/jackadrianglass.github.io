The Plan:
The idea is to largely base the website off of one that I found
[here](https://jekyll-theme-minimal-resume.netlify.app/)

# Main Page

- [ ] Creative Coding Splash Screen
- [ ] Link Tree
- [ ] Brief Section
    - [ ] Head Shot
    - [ ] About Yourself
    - [ ] Contact Information
- [ ] Skill List
    - Split by technology
    - Probably have some images around each technology used
    - Brief description of the projects involved
- [ ] Work Experience
    - Timeline view
    - Outline each project that you worked on during that time
    - Reverse chronological order
- [ ] Side Projects
    - Have little cards that link to the repos
    - Have a little blurb on what tech is used in each project
    - Make a wip tag for the ones that aren't complete
- [ ] Shout out byte club somewhere

# Creative Coding

- [ ] Tiled Lines
    - [ ] Have it sizeable to a different width than height
    - [ ] Inject a color scheme into it
    - [ ] Make it the splash screen of the main page
    - [ ] Handle resize events (which probably just means redraw it?)
- [ ] Find some other creative coding ideas to work on
