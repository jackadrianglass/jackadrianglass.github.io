The Plan:
The idea is to largely base the website off of one that I found
[here](https://jekyll-theme-minimal-resume.netlify.app/)

So the front page is an interactive resume that has the following layout
1. Have a top navbar for other projects that you can extend this site with
2. Main photo for the landing of the website
 * Should occupy the whole screen
 * Ideally have a fun moving background
 * Have your linktree on there
3. Have a brief on yourself
 * Basics i.e. name, age, location
 * A tl;dr about me
 * A photo
4. Work Experience
 * Super basic listing of what your work experience is
 * Super basic listing of what your schooling is
 * Maybe add a cool quote that you enjoy
 * Try to do this in that fun timeline thing that you've seen everywhere
5. Skill list
 * Have a list of skills in a 5 star ranking
 * Add some animations when hovering over the stars
 * Add tooltips to have an explanation for each skill and link projects if applicable
 * Include the following sections
   * Languages
   * Tools
   * Frameworks/Libraries
   * Paradigms and Philosophies
6. Projects
 * A list of side projects
 * Make sure that the complete ones come first
 * Tool tips for adding details about
   * Language used
   * Libraries used
   * Subject matter that it focuses on
   * Completion status
* See if you can do some github querying to get impages and previews from github
8. Have a sections navbar floating on the right
 * have it appear like a scroll bar
 * expands when hovering over it
 * Have smooth scrolling when navigating to various part of the resume
 * Have it expanded when at the top of the page
